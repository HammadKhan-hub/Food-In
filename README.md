## 🎨 Customization Guide

Here is a guide on how to modify the key elements of your template:

### 1. **Color Scheme and Fonts**

* **Change Accent Color:** The primary highlight color (e.g., button colors) is easily managed via CSS variables.
    * File: `css/style.css`
    * Find the `:root` selector at the top of the file and modify the color variable:
        ```css
        :root {
            --accent-color: #f4b400; /* Current Accent Color */
        }
        ```
    Replace `#f4b400` with your preferred Hex Color Code.
* **Fonts:** Fonts are loaded via a link in the `<head>` section of `index.html`.

### 2. **Content Editing (Menu, Text, Images)**

All static text content is located within the `index.html` file.

* **Header and Logo:** Update the restaurant name or logo source within the `<header>` or `<nav>` tags.
* **Main Headings/Text:** Edit the text content found within `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` tags throughout the file.
* **Menu Section:** Locate the **`<section class="menu-section">`** tag. Menu items, descriptions, and prices should be updated within the structured `div` elements in this section.

### 3. **Image Replacement**

For a dark theme to look premium, **high-resolution images** are essential.

* Save your new images inside the **`images/`** folder.
* Update the `src` attributes for all `<img>` tags in `index.html` to point to your new file names.

## 🔗 Reservation/Contact Form Setup

The contact form is front-end ready but requires an external service to handle form submissions (i.e., collecting data and sending an email).

### Recommended Service: Formspree

1.  Create an account and set up a new form on **Formspree**.
2.  Copy the unique **Endpoint URL** provided by the service.
3.  In `index.html`, find the `<form>` tag and paste the URL into the `action` attribute:

```html
<form action="[PASTE YOUR FORMSPREE ENDPOINT URL HERE]" method="POST">
    </form>
